            Here are some of my key skills with examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unfazed by hard work</b> - I have worked jobs in the film industry where I regularly worked 12-16 hour days.</li>
            <li><b>Self-starter</b> - I like to set myself difficult challenges, such as learning coding whilst working full time.</li>
            <li><b>Disciplined</b> - When I decide to do something, I stick to it, such as running every single day or keeping my Duolingo streak alive.</li>
        </ul>
